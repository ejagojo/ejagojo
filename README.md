### A Bit More About Me

Hey there! I’m Eljohn, but most of my friends call me Ej, a senior at the University of Massachusetts Lowell with 4 years of experience in C/C++ and JavaScript. I’ve got a passion for building things—whether it’s a complex web application or a new personal best at the gym.

Currently, I’m working on an exciting project called **KyMo**, a social networking platform aimed at bringing individuals and teams closer together. The future looks bright, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes us!

When I’m not coding or lifting, you can find me gaming, playing basketball, or just enjoying life. I like to keep things laid-back and modern—think skibidi, not dad jokes.

Feel free to reach out if you want to connect or collaborate. Let's build something amazing together!

😄 Stay awesome!
